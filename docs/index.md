# Overview

Navigation Compose Extended is a complementary library for AndroidX Jetpack Navigation Compose to 
improve creation of navigation elements, as destination routes, arguments, deep links, â€¦ in a 
more idiomatic way than using literals.

With this library you can define models for your navigation destinations, navigation arguments, ...
and it automatically creates the navigation routes, arguments and deep link variables for the NavHost.

It also provides functions to navigate to navigation destinations using these models and arguments 
keys, and functions to retrieve arguments values in a more secure way.
